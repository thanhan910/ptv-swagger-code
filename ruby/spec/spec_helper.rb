#PTV Timetable API - Version 3

#The PTV Timetable API provides direct access to Public Transport Victoria's public transport timetable data.    The API returns scheduled timetable, route and stop data for all metropolitan and regional train, tram and bus services in Victoria, including Night Network(Night Train and Night Tram data are included in metropolitan train and tram services data, respectively, whereas Night Bus is a separate route type).    The API also returns real-time data for metropolitan train, tram and bus services (where this data is made available to PTV), as well as disruption information, stop facility information, and access to myki ticket outlet data.    This Swagger is for Version 3 of the PTV Timetable API. By using this documentation you agree to comply with the licence and terms of service.    Train timetable data is updated daily, while the remaining data is updated weekly, taking into account any planned timetable changes (for example, due to holidays or planned disruptions). The PTV timetable API is the same API used by PTV for its apps. To access the most up to date data PTV has (including real-time data) you must use the API dynamically.    You can access the PTV Timetable API through a HTTP or HTTPS interface, as follows:        base URL / version number / API name / query string  The base URL is either:    *  http://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au  or    *  https://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au    The Swagger JSON file is available at http://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au/swagger/docs/v3    Frequently asked questions are available on the PTV website at http://ptv.vic.gov.au/apifaq    Links to the following information are also provided on the PTV website at http://ptv.vic.gov.au/ptv-timetable-api/  * How to register for an API key and calculate a signature  * PTV Timetable API V2 to V3 Migration Guide  * PTV Timetable API Data Quality Statement    All information about how to use the API is in this documentation. PTV cannot provide technical support for the API.

# The following  was generated by the `rspec --init` command. Conventionally, all
# specs live under a `spec` directory, which RSpec adds to the `$LOAD_PATH`.
# The generated `.rspec` file contains `--require spec_helper` which will cause
# this file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any
# files.
#
# Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as
# light-weight as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file
# will add to the boot time of your test suite on EVERY test run, even for an
# individual file that may not need all of that loaded. Instead, consider making
# a separate helper file that requires the additional dependencies and performs
# the additional setup, and require it from the spec files that actually need
# it.
#
# The `.rspec` file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that
# users commonly want.

    # This option will default to `true` in RSpec 4. It makes the `description`
    # and `failure_message` of custom matchers include text for helper methods
    # defined using `chain`, e.g.:
    #     be_bigger_than(2).and_smaller_than(4).description
    #     # => "be bigger than 2 and smaller than 4"
    # ...rather than:
    #     # => "be bigger than 2"

  # library (such as bogus or mocha) by changing the `mock_with` option here.
